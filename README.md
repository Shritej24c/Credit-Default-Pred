# Credit Default Prediction using XGBoost and Neural Network

**Importance of Credit Default prediction**

In 2022 alone, American Express generated around $53 Billion dollars of revenue and it's only source of revenue is credit cards. Moreover, TransUnion forecasted severe credit card delinquencies to rise to 2.6% at the end of 2023 from 2.1% at the close of 2022. Unsecured personal loan delinquency rates will increase to 4.3% from 4.1% in the same timeframe.

Therefore, credit default prediction has always been central to managing risk in a consumer lending business. Credit default prediction allows lenders to optimize lending decisions, and minimize risk and exposure, which leads to a better customer experience and sound business economics. By predicting which customers are at the highest risk of defaulting on their credit card accounts, issuers can take proactive steps to minimize risk and exposure.

Now, given the huge amount of data on customers is readily available and the number of signals, it's lucrative to involve Machine Learning algorithms to make predictions
