# Credit Default Prediction using XGBoost and Neural Network

**Importance of Credit Default prediction**

In 2022 alone, American Express generated around $53 Billion dollars of revenue and it's only source of revenue is credit cards. Moreover, TransUnion forecasted severe credit card delinquencies to rise to 2.6% at the end of 2023 from 2.1% at the close of 2022. By predicting which customers are at the highest risk of defaulting on their credit card accounts, issuers can take proactive steps to minimize risk and exposure.

Now, given the huge amount of data on customers is readily available and the number of signals, it's lucrative to involve Machine Learning algorithms to make predictions for defaults. 

**Data**

Historical Credit Card (CC) data consists of 458,913 customers spread across 13 months on 190 variables in categories like Payment, Spend and Balance
30k – 40k observation each month and % of customers defaulted in each month [23%, 28%]

Target Variable = 1 if customer default on CC payment
      = 0 if customer didn’t default

**Features**

All Features divided into 5 categories: Delinquency, Payment, Balance, Risk & Spend
